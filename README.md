# Order restricted designs for biomarker-stratified trials
In randomized placebo controlled trials with a predefined subgroup based on baseline biomarkers, it is often assumed that a biomarker defined subgroup, frequently referred to as the biomarker positive subgroup, has the same or higher treatment effect compared to its compliment, the biomarker negative subgroup. The goal is to show that the treatment is effective compared to a placebo in the biomarker positive group or in the overall population. It might also be desirable to test a treatment effect in the biomarker negative subgroup. We use the isotonic assumption about the treatment effects in the two subgroups to construct a set of decision rules for these objectives. We tabulate optimal two-stage designs for this problem. The proposed order restricted approach requires a smaller sample size compared to existing approaches. The savings are especially substantial when testing the treatment effect in the biomarker positive and negative groups making such testing feasible.
